<h2 align="center">Spark AR Studio is an augmented reality platform by Facebook for Mac & Windows that allows you to somewhat easily create AR effects for mobile cameras. Think of it like Photoshop or Sketch, but for AR.</h2>
<h3 align="center">Here is my first ever Spark AR Effect made using Spark AR Studio. This color effect was made for the hackathon named NE-A-THON organised by Reskill. </h3>
